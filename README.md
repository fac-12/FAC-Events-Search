# FAC-Events-Search

## Intro
We hope that this app makes it easier to find, share and discuss events of interest to the London FAC community without having to wade through Meetup.com or monitor Gitter channels, while building a sense of broader FAC community.

Our initial prototype is available here:  https://invis.io/RBF7TJ4J8

## Code Review Notes
Our app in its current state is available at fac-eventfinder.herokuapp.com
